# Cusca Casa

This is an Android App coded in Kotlin to reach out to an Azure SQL Database containing readings emitted by an IoT Sensor, and present a series of visual charts and useful information.

This is a sister project to the https://github.com/lokijota/Azure-RPi-BME680 repo, which describes the IoT Sensor, what information is being uploaded, and how it is stored.
